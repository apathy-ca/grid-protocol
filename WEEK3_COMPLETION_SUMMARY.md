# Week 3 Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Focus:** Security & Architecture Documentation

---

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Security Documentation ✅
**File:** [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
- Comprehensive security model and philosophy
- Detailed threat model with mitigations
- Security best practices for authentication, authorization, audit, and operations
- Vulnerability reporting process
- Link to the Shadow IT playbook

### 2. Architecture Documentation ✅
**File:** [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- High-level reference architecture diagram
- Detailed explanation of component roles
- Deployment patterns (centralized gateway, sidecar proxy, hybrid)
- Scaling considerations for the policy engine, audit log, and gateway
- Performance optimization strategies (caching, asynchronous audit logging)

### 3. Shadow IT Playbook ✅
**File:** [`SHADOW_IT_PLAYBOOK.md`](SHADOW_IT_PLAYBOOK.md)
- Operational playbook for detecting, responding to, and preventing shadow IT
- Detection strategies (network scanning, policy-level detection, runtime monitoring)
- Response procedures (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- Prevention strategies (network controls, agent-level enforcement, training)
- Monitoring and alerting guidelines
