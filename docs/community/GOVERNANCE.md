# GRID Protocol Governance Model

This document outlines the governance model for the GRID Protocol Specification project.

## Guiding Principles

- **Openness:** GRID is an open standard, and all discussions and decisions are public.
- **Transparency:** The decision-making process is transparent and documented.
- **Inclusivity:** We welcome contributions from everyone and strive to create a diverse community.
- **Consensus:** We aim for consensus in our decisions, but have a clear process for resolving disagreements.
- **Vendor-Neutral:** GRID is a vendor-neutral standard, and no single company or individual has control.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors

Anyone who contributes to the project in any form (code, documentation, issues, etc.) is a contributor.

**Responsibilities:**
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Adhere to the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Participate in discussions and provide feedback.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the project.

**Current Maintainers:**
- `@grid-protocol/maintainers`

**Responsibilities:**
- Review and merge pull requests.
- Triage and manage issues.
- Enforce the Code of Conduct.
- Guide the technical direction of the project.
- Make decisions based on community consensus.

**Becoming a Maintainer:**

- Be nominated by an existing maintainer and approved by a majority of the maintainers.

### Spec Shepherds

Spec Shepherds are responsible for the integrity and quality of the GRID specification documents.

**Current Spec Shepherds:**
- `@grid-protocol/spec-shepherds`

**Responsibilities:**
- Review all changes to the core specification documents.
- Ensure consistency and clarity of the specification.
- Guide the evolution of the specification.

### Community Managers

Community Managers are responsible for the health and growth of the GRID community.

**Current Community Managers:**

- Foster a welcoming and inclusive community.
- Manage community communication channels.
- Organize community events and meetings.
- Promote the adoption of GRID.

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus

The default decision-making process is consensus. We strive to reach a decision that all parties can agree on.

### Voting

If consensus cannot be reached, the maintainers will hold a vote.

- **Majority Vote:** Most decisions require a simple majority of the maintainers.
- **Supermajority Vote:** Major changes to the specification or governance model require a 2/3 majority of the maintainers.

### Lazy Consensus

For non-controversial changes, we use a lazy consensus model. If no one objects to a proposal within a reasonable time frame (typically 7 days), it is considered approved.

## Proposing Changes

### Specification Changes

1. **Create an Issue:** Propose the change in a GitHub issue with the `enhancement` or `spec-clarification` label.
2. **Discussion:** The community discusses the proposal in the issue.
3. **Proposal Document:** For major changes, create a formal proposal document.
4. **Pull Request:** Create a pull request with the proposed changes.
5. **Review:** The Spec Shepherds and maintainers review the pull request.
6. **Merge:** The pull request is merged after approval.

### Governance Changes

Changes to this governance model require a supermajority vote of the maintainers.

## Release Process

### Versioning

GRID follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- **Major (vX.0.0):** Breaking changes to the specification.
- **Minor (v0.X.0):** Backward-compatible additions to the specification.
- **Patch (v0.0.X):** Backward-compatible bug fixes and clarifications.

### Release Cadence

- **Minor Releases:** Every 3-6 months.
- **Major Releases:** As needed, with a long period for community feedback.

## Conflict Resolution

If you have a disagreement with a decision or a member of the community, please follow these steps:

1. **Discuss:** Try to resolve the issue directly with the other person in a respectful manner.
2. **Escalate:** If the issue cannot be resolved, bring it to the attention of the maintainers.
3. **Mediation:** The maintainers will mediate the discussion and try to find a resolution.
4. **Final Decision:** If no resolution can be found, the maintainers will make a final decision.
