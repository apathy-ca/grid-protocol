# GRID Protocol v0.1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 28, 2025

We are excited to announce the v0.1.0 release of the GRID (Governed Resource Interaction Definition) Protocol Specification. This release marks the completion of the initial 6-week implementation plan, resulting in a comprehensive and high-quality set of documentation for the GRID protocol.

GRID is a universal governance protocol for machine-to-machine interactions, designed to be protocol-agnostic, federated, and secure. This initial version is reverse-engineered from the production-proven SARK (Secure Autonomous Resource Kontroller) reference implementation.

## What's New in v0.1.0

This release includes the complete GRID Protocol Specification v0.1, along with a rich set of supporting documentation, examples, and tools to help the community adopt and implement the protocol.

*   **SARK Gap Analysis:** A detailed analysis of the SARK reference implementation's compliance with the GRID specification.

### Getting Started
*   **README, Quickstart, and Tutorial:** A comprehensive set of documents to help new users get started with GRID.

### Community & Contribution
