# GRID: Universal Authorization for Distributed Systems

---

## The Problem: Authorization is a Mess

-   Microservices, APIs, AI, IoT...
-   Every system has its own auth model
-   Inconsistent policies
-   Security gaps (Shadow IT)

---

## The Solution: A Universal Standard

**GRID:** Governance and aRmor Integration standard for Decentralized systems

A single, consistent, policy-based authorization framework for everything.

---

## How it Works

1.  **Centralized Policy:** Define access policies in Rego.
2.  **Decentralized Enforcement:** GRID adapters enforce policies at the edge.
3.  **Universal Protocol:** A simple, standard protocol for authorization decisions.

---

## Key Features

-   **Universal:** One auth model to rule them all.
-   **Decentralized:** No single point of failure.
-   **Policy-Based:** Expressive, auditable policies.
-   **Extensible:** Integrates with anything.

---

## Use Cases

-   Microservice Authorization
-   API Access Control
-   AI Agent Governance
-   IoT Security
