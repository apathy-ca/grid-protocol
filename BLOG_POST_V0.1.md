We are thrilled to announce the v0.1 release of the Governance and aRmor Integration standard for Decentralized systems (GRID). This release marks a major milestone in our journey to create a universal, policy-based authorization framework for the modern era of distributed systems.

## What is GRID?

GRID is a specification for a decentralized authorization protocol that enables fine-grained, policy-based access control across any system, from microservices and APIs to AI agents and IoT devices. It is designed to be:

- **Universal:** A single, consistent authorization model for all your systems.
- **Decentralized:** No single point of failure or control.
- **Policy-Based:** Expressive, human-readable policies using Rego.
- **Extensible:** Easily integrates with existing systems via protocol adapters.

## What's in v0.1?

This initial release includes:

- **The GRID Protocol Specification:** The complete technical specification for the GRID protocol.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Everything you need to get started, including a quickstart guide, tutorial, and in-depth documentation on architecture, security, and more.
- **Policy Examples:** A collection of Rego policy examples for common use cases like RBAC, ABAC, and time-based access.
- **Testing Framework:** A full suite of compliance tests, integration examples, and performance benchmarks to ensure robust implementations.

## Getting Started

- **Explore the documentation:** Start with the [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) and [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md).
- **Check out the examples:** The [`examples/`](examples/) directory contains a wealth of practical examples.
- **Join the community:** We welcome contributions! See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. We are already working on advanced features like a policy playground, visualization tools, and more.

We believe GRID has the potential to fundamentally change the way we think about authorization. We invite you to join us on this journey.
